# SMS_Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the classifier effectively identifies and filters unwanted messages.

# Key Features:

. Accurate classification: High precision and recall in distinguishing spam from legitimate messages.
. Efficient performance: Optimized for speed and resource utilization.
. Scalability: Capable of handling large volumes of SMS data.
. Customizable: Allows for easy adaptation to different datasets and classification criteria.

# Technologies:

Python: Core programming language for model development and implementation.
Machine learning libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for building and training the classifier.
NLP tools: NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
Data visualization: Matplotlib or Seaborn for exploratory data analysis and model performance visualization.

# Dataset:

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham, enabling robust model training and evaluation.

# Usage:

. Preprocessing: Clean and prepare SMS text data for analysis.
. Feature extraction: Convert text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning.
. Model training: Build and train a classification model using selected algorithms.
. Evaluation: Assess model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
. Deployment: Integrate the classifier into real-world applications for SMS filtering.
